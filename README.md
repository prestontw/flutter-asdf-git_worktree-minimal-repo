# sample_for_pubspec

A new Flutter project.
This was used to reproduce a strange case of pre-commit hooks failing to work.
The specific combination of features is `asdf`, `flutter`, `pre-commit`, and `git-worktree`.
Not using `asdf` caused pre-commit to work fine.

## To reproduce:

- Check out this repository
- Install pre-commit (https://pre-commit.com/)
- Install the hooks in this repo (`pre-commit install`)
- Install `asdf` (https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)
- Install `asdf-flutter` plugin (https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#_4-install-a-plugin (`asdf plugin add flutter`))
- Install version through `asdf`: `asdf install`
- Verify that everything works by making a dummy change and committing. If you run into flutter errors, `cd` to where `flutter` was installed (something like `~/.asdf/installs/flutter/3.3.10-stable` then checkout beta channel with `git checkout beta`)
- Make a git-worktree branch as a sibling of the main repo (`git worktree add sample-for-pre-commit`) and `cd` there
- Make a dummy change and commit it---watch the pre-commit output and how it doesn't know which channel it is on:

Flutter ‚Ä¢ channel pre-commit-in-worktree ‚Ä¢ git@github.com:prestontw/flutter-asdf-git_worktree-minimal-repo.git
Framework ‚Ä¢ revision 8e93fdcde9 (22 minutes ago) ‚Ä¢ 2023-01-05 00:09:28 -0600

```

Note that the Flutter channel is not an official flutter channel but the name of the
git worktree branch we just made (in the above example, it's `pre-commit-in-worktree`).
Also note that the framework revision commit is local to this repo (`8e93fdcde9`).

I think this is an issue with `asdf` because this works fine if I use a local installation
of flutter. And I think this is an issue with `asdf` over `asdf-flutter` since
`asdf-flutter` is mostly concerned with installing and listing versions.

Note that this could also be an issue with `flutter` that `asdf` raises.

For another quick note, this is specific to non-main git worktree folders.
Trying this in the "main" folder works fine:
