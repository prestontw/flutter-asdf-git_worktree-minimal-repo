# flutter-git-worktree-precommit-minimal-repo

A new Flutter project.
This was used to reproduce a strange case of pre-commit hooks failing to work.
The specific combination of features is `flutter`, `pre-commit`, and `git-worktree`.

## To reproduce:

- Check out this repository
- Install pre-commit (https://pre-commit.com/)
- Install the hooks in this repo (`pre-commit install`)
- Install `flutter` through `git` (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux#install-flutter-manually). I used the specific command `git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b beta` to check out the beta branch.
- Add the `bin` directory of `flutter` to your `PATH`
- Verify that everything works by making a dummy change in the checked-out repo and committing. (If things fail, try committing again and see if that passes.)
- Make a git-worktree branch as a sibling of the main repo (`git worktree add ../sample-for-pre-commit`) and `cd` there
- Make a dummy change and commit it---watch the pre-commit output and how it doesn't know which channel it is on:

Note that the Flutter channel is not an official flutter channel but the name of the
git worktree branch we just made (in the above example, it's `pre-commit-in-worktree`).
Also note that the framework revision commit is local to this repo (`8e93fdcde9`).

The flutter version information might also display as
```

Currently not on an official channel.
```

I am not sure whether this is an issue with `pre-commit` or `flutter` that causes
git-worktree information to be picked up instead of flutter information.

For another quick note, this is specific to non-main git worktree folders.
Trying this in the "main" folder works fine:
```

Trying this outside of `pre-commit` also works fine:
